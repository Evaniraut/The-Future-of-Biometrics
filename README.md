#  The Future of Biometrics: Beyond Fingerprints and Facial Recognition

##  Project Overview  
This report explores the future of biometric authentication, going beyond traditional fingerprint and facial recognition methods. It discusses the limitations of current systems, evaluates emerging biometric technologies, and analyzes a real-world breach (Biostar 2) to demonstrate the need for advanced, secure solutions.

##  Objectives  
- Investigate limitations of existing biometric systems  
- Explore emerging technologies in biometric authentication  
- Analyze the Biostar 2 breach and its implications  
- Propose futuristic biometric solutions  
- Document insights in a well-structured, academic report

##  Contents  
- Overview of biometrics and their working mechanisms  
- Classification of biometrics (physiological and behavioral)  
- Case study: The Biostar 2 data breach  
- Reflection on how future biometrics could prevent such breaches  
- Visual illustrations and diagrams  
- Conclusion and future scope
